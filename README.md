## Ways to Install

### Setting Your Project Up

To use GQuery, you must first enable the Google Sheets API in your Apps Script project. To do this:

1. Go to your project editor and click on the plus button next to "Services"
2. Find "Google Sheets API" in the list and click on it to add it to your project.
3. Leave the version as-is and the identifier as-is, then click Add.

### (Recommended) As a NPM Package

If you use a build toolchain in your Apps Script project, like Rollup or Vite, this is the preferred installation method.

- First, create a file called `.npmrc` in the same directory as your package.json and add `@fcps-tssc:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com`
- To install via the command line: `npm install @fcps-tssc/gquery@1.5.0`
- To add in your `package.json` dependencies: `"@fcps-tssc/gquery": "1.5.0"`

You'll call the GQuery class via `new GQuery()`

### As an Apps Script Library

For traditional Apps Script projects, it is possible to import the Apps Script code as a library.

1. Go to your project editor and press the plus button next to "Libraries"
2. Enter the following script ID: `1UqTjUrX6rnMMzbYJPJRPk3cmLCYc7n7FZwZq6Q7gG-j3rTqj15LC953B` Then press Look up
3. Select a version, _generally_ you will want to choose the latest pinned release. (The highest number that isn't HEAD) The development branch can sometimes be unstable.
4. Change the identifier if desired, press Add.

You'll call the GQuery class via `new GQuery.GQuery()` (The first GQuery is your identifier)

### As a Standalone Script

You can also copy and paste the code from `dist/bundle.global.js` directly into your Apps Script project as a standalone script file. It is recommended to go to a tag release and copy from there to ensure stability. (ex. v1.5.0) The file type does not matter and can be placed in a .gs file without issue.

You'll call the GQuery class via `new GQuery.GQuery()` (The first GQuery is your identifier)

## Type-Safe Queries with Standard Schema

GQuery supports [Standard Schema](https://standardschema.dev) — a common interface implemented by popular schema libraries like [Zod](https://zod.dev), [Valibot](https://valibot.dev), and [ArkType](https://arktype.io). Passing a schema to `.from()` gives you fully typed rows across all operations without adding any runtime dependency to GQuery itself.

> **Note:** Standard Schema support requires a TypeScript build toolchain (e.g. the [NPM package](#recommended-as-a-npm-package) install method). It has no effect in plain `.gs` files.

### Type Inference Only

Pass your schema as the second argument to `.from()`. GQuery uses the schema's output type to type all rows returned by `.get()`, `.update()`, and `.append()` — with no runtime cost. The `.where()` filter function and `.update()` callback are also typed automatically.

```typescript
import { z } from "zod";

const EmployeeSchema = z.object({
  Name: z.string(),
  Email: z.string().email(),
  Department: z.string(),
  Active: z.boolean(),
  StartDate: z.date(),
});

const gq = new GQuery("your-spreadsheet-id");

// result.rows is typed as GQueryRow<{ Name: string; Email: string; ... }>[]
const result = gq
  .from("Employees", EmployeeSchema)
  .where((row) => row.Active) // row.Active is typed as boolean
  .get();

// TypeScript will error if the wrong shape is passed
gq.from("Employees", EmployeeSchema).append({
  Name: "Alice",
  Email: "alice@example.com",
  Department: "Engineering",
  Active: true,
  StartDate: new Date(),
});
```

You can also specify a type manually without a schema using the generic type parameter — this is a compile-time assertion only and performs no validation:

```typescript
type EmployeeRow = { Name: string; Department: string; Active: boolean };

const result = gq.from<EmployeeRow>("Employees").get();
// result.rows is GQueryRow<EmployeeRow>[]
```

### Runtime Validation

By default, the schema is used purely for TypeScript types. To also validate each row at runtime, pass `validate: true` to `.get()`, `.update()`, or `.append()`. GQuery will run each row through the schema's `validate()` function and throw a `GQuerySchemaError` if any row fails.

```typescript
// Validates every row returned from the sheet against EmployeeSchema
const result = gq.from("Employees", EmployeeSchema).get({ validate: true });

// Validates each item before writing to the sheet
gq.from("Employees", EmployeeSchema).append(
  {
    Name: "Bob",
    Email: "not-an-email",
    Department: "Design",
    Active: true,
    StartDate: new Date(),
  },
  { validate: true }, // throws GQuerySchemaError — Email fails .email()
);
```

> **Google Apps Script limitation:** Only synchronous schema validation is supported. Zod and Valibot both validate synchronously by default. If a schema's `validate()` returns a `Promise`, GQuery will throw immediately.

### Handling Validation Errors

`GQuerySchemaError` extends `Error` and exposes the full list of issues from the schema library, plus the raw row that failed.

```typescript
import { GQuerySchemaError } from "@fcps-tssc/gquery";

try {
  const result = gq.from("Employees", EmployeeSchema).get({ validate: true });
} catch (e) {
  if (e instanceof GQuerySchemaError) {
    console.error("Validation failed:", e.message);
    // e.issues — ReadonlyArray<{ message: string; path?: ... }>
    // e.row    — the raw row object that failed
    e.issues.forEach((issue) => console.error(issue.message));
  }
}
```

### Using GET

Using GET requires that you first specify a sheet to query with the .from() function, then you can optionally specify columns to return with .select() and filter rows with .where(). Optionally, .join() can be used to include columns from other sheets. Finally, you call .get() to execute the query and return the results.

```javascript
const gq = new GQuery();
const result = gq
  .from("Sheet1")
  .select(["Name", "Age"])
  .where((row) => row.Age > 18)
  .get();
```

```json
{
  "headers": ["Name", "Age"],
  "rows": [
    { "Name": "Alice", "Age": 30 },
    { "Name": "Bob", "Age": 25 }
  ]
}
```

### Using GET MANY

GET MANY allows you to retrieve data from multiple sheets in a single query. You specify the sheets and then call .getMany() to execute the query.

```javascript
const gq = new GQuery();
const result = gq.getMany(["Buildings", "Rooms"]);
```

```json
{
  "Buildings": {
    "headers": ["Building Name", "Address"],
    "rows": [
      { "Building Name": "Library", "Address": "123 Main St" },
      { "Building Name": "Gym", "Address": "456 Elm St" }
    ]
  },
  "Rooms": {
    "headers": ["Room Number", "Capacity"],
    "rows": [
      { "Room Number": "101", "Capacity": 30 },
      { "Room Number": "102", "Capacity": 20 }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Using QUERY

QUERY allows you to use Google's Query Visualization Language to retrieve data from a sheet. You specify the sheet and the query string, then call .query() to execute. This is often faster than using the modifier functions and can be more concise for complex queries, but it does not support joins or multiple sheets. It is also read-only.

```javascript
const gq = new GQuery();
const result = gq.from("Sheet1").query("SELECT Name, Age WHERE Age > 18");
```

```json
{
  "headers": ["Name", "Age"],
  "rows": [
    { "Name": "Alice", "Age": 30 },
    { "Name": "Bob", "Age": 25 }
  ]
}
```

### Using UPDATE

UPDATE allows you to update rows in a sheet based on a condition. You specify the sheet, the new values, and a condition to determine which rows to update. Then call .update() to execute.

```javascript
const gq = new GQuery();
gq.from("Sheet1")
  .where((row) => row.Age > 18)
  .update((row) => {
    row.Status = "Active";
  });
```

```
{
    "headers": ["Name", "Age", "Status"],
    "rows": [
        { "Name": "Alice", "Age": 30, "Status": "Active" },
        { "Name": "Bob", "Age": 25, "Status": "Active" }
    ]
}
```

### Using APPEND

APPEND allows you to add new rows to a sheet. You specify the sheet and the new row data, then call .append() to execute.

```javascript
const gq = new GQuery();
gq.from("Sheet1").append({ Name: "Charlie", Age: 22 });
// Also accepts arrays: .append([{ Name: "Charlie", Age: 22 }, { Name: "David", Age: 28 }])
```

```
{
    "headers": ["Name", "Age"],
    "rows": [
        { "Name": "Charlie", "Age": 22 }
    ]
}
```

### Using DELETE

DELETE allows you to remove rows from a sheet based on a condition. You specify the sheet and a condition to determine which rows to delete, then call .delete() to execute.

```javascript
const gq = new GQuery();
gq.from("Sheet1")
  .where((row) => row.Age < 18)
  .delete();
```

```
{
    "deletedRows": 2
}
```

### Using JOINS

JOIN allows you to combine data from multiple sheets based on a common column. You specify the sheet to join with, the column to join on, and optionally which columns to return from the joined sheet.

Arguments:

- `sheetName`: The name of the sheet to join with.
- `sheetColumn`: The column in the joined sheet to join on.
- `joinColumn`: The column in the current sheet to join on. If not provided, it defaults to the same column name as `sheetColumn`.
- `selectColumns`: An array of column names to return from the joined sheet. If not provided, all columns from the joined sheet will be included.

```javascript
const gq = new GQuery();
const result = gq
  .from("Assets")
  .join("Users", "LoginId", "Assigned To", ["Name", "Department"])
  .get();
```

```json
{
  "headers": ["Id", "Model", "Assigned To", "Name", "Department"],
  "rows": [
    {
      "Id": "A001",
      "Model": "Laptop",
      "Assigned To": "user1",
      "Name": "Alice",
      "Department": "IT"
    },
    {
      "Id": "A002",
      "Model": "Monitor",
      "Assigned To": "user2",
      "Name": "Bob",
      "Department": "Design"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Benchmarking Performance

GQuery has been tested against native Apps Script methods for retrieving data from sheets. v1.4.0 marked the first time that GET performance matched SheetQuery, as native SpreadsheetApp logic is sufficient for reading data. However, SpreadsheetApp becomes exponentially slower when modifying data. As GQuery uses the Advanced Sheet Service, data updates are rapid and a bulk of processing time is application logic.

|        | v1.4.1 | v1.3.1 | v1.2.0 | SheetQuery |
| :----- | :----: | :----: | :----: | :--------: |
| GET    | 646ms  | 1311ms | 1660ms |   655ms    |
| UPDATE | 448ms  | 729ms  | 661ms  |  18070ms   |
| APPEND | 354ms  | 365ms  | 709ms  |  33559ms   |
| DELETE | 496ms  | 739ms  | 556ms  |  13959ms   |

The QUERY method is especially fast for large spreadsheets, as it leverages Google's internal query engine. However, it is limited to read-only operations and does not support joins.

| Total: 162,527 | ALL ROWS:\* | FILTERED ROWS: 656 |
| -------------- | :---------: | :----------------: |
| GET            |   7890ms    |       8199ms       |
| QUERY          |   7844ms    |       1821ms       |
